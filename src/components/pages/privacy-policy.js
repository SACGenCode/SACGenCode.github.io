From time to time, SAC Code-Gen may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p className='mt-2'>SAC Code-Gen also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://sacgencode.js.org blog posts.
